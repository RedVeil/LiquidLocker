User Deposits HND into `LiHNDManager` to receive liHND -> `LiHNDManager` locks all through `liHNDStrategy` -> user Stakes liHND in `LiHNDChef` to receive rewards.

-- LiquidDriver doesnt allow the user to boost their own farms on HND or direct gauge weights. Instead LiquidDriver uses the voting power to farm and rewards the staker with a part of those profits.
